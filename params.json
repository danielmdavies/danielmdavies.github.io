{"name":"echem.io","tagline":"Simplicity. Extensibility.","body":"### Welcome to echem.io\r\nWe specialize in software and hardware systems for electrochemical and thermodynamic research and education. \r\n\r\nOur [lab](http://steingart.princeton.edu) has two open source projects we would like to to move into the commercial space.\r\n\r\n####[The Ardustat](http://steingart.princeton.edu/ardustat)\r\nIs a fully functional potentiostat/galvanostat. It has comparable hardware specs to a lot of the commercially made products and comes with an elegant customizable software package. This allows users to complete a huge variety of electrochemical tests. The Ardustat is capable of producing cyclic voltammograms, and cycling batteries for weeks at a time. The best part about it is that each channel costs about $60 to build.\r\n\r\n####[Pithy](http://pithy.io)\r\nPithy is Python in your browser. There is code on the left, and output on the right.. It is to python what google docs is to writing, complete with operational transformations. With Pithy you can write, run, share, and fork python programs easily while it saves every diff you do, so you can always roll back. Imagine if you were running a lab, teaching a class, or collaborating on data analysis: The ability to share and edit analysis scripts non-destructively with automatic saving would be powerful. Pithy gives you that functionality.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n- [Dan Steingart](@dansteingart) \r\n- [Dan Davies](@danielmdavies)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n- dmdavies@princeton.edu\r\n- steingart@princeton.edu\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
